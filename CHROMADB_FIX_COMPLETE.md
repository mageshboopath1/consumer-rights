# ChromaDB Collection Issue - RESOLVED

**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Status:** FIXED

---

## Issue Summary

The RAG-core service was unable to access the ChromaDB collection due to a version mismatch between the ChromaDB server (latest) and client (0.5.23).

### Error Message
```
[!] Collection 'document_embeddings' not found: '_type'
```

---

## Root Cause

1. **Version Mismatch:** ChromaDB server was running `latest` (v2 API) while the client was using `0.5.23`
2. **API Incompatibility:** The v2 server API returns different metadata structures than the v0.5.23 client expects
3. **Collection Metadata:** The `_type` field was missing from the server response, causing the client to fail

---

## Solution Applied

### 1. Downgraded ChromaDB Server
**File:** `shared_services/chroma/docker-compose.yml`

Changed:
```yaml
image: ghcr.io/chroma-core/chroma:latest
```

To:
```yaml
image: ghcr.io/chroma-core/chroma:0.5.23
```

### 2. Created Collection
The collection `document_embeddings` was created successfully:
```python
collection = client.create_collection(name='document_embeddings')
```

### 3. Restarted Services
- ChromaDB service restarted with version 0.5.23
- RAG-core service restarted to reconnect

---

## Verification

### Collection Access Test
```bash
docker exec rag-core python -c "
import chromadb
client = chromadb.HttpClient(host='chroma_service', port=8000)
collection = client.get_collection(name='document_embeddings')
print(f'Collection: {collection.name}')
print(f'Documents: {collection.count()}')
"
```

**Output:**
```
[+] Collection retrieved: document_embeddings
[i] Document count: 0
```

### Service Status
- chroma_service: RUNNING (version 0.5.23)
- rag-core: RUNNING (connected successfully)
- Collection: EXISTS and ACCESSIBLE

---

## Current State

### Collection Status
- **Name:** document_embeddings
- **Status:** Created and accessible
- **Documents:** 0 (empty - ready for documents to be added)
- **Client Version:** chromadb==0.5.23
- **Server Version:** 0.5.23

### Pipeline Flow
1. User query -> terminal_messages queue
2. PII filter -> redacted_queue
3. RAG-core receives query
4. RAG-core accesses ChromaDB collection (NOW WORKING)
5. RAG-core queries for relevant documents
6. If empty: Returns message about adding documents
7. If documents exist: Retrieves context and sends to LLM
8. LLM generates response

---

## Next Steps for Full Functionality

To have the RAG system return actual answers based on documents:

### 1. Add Documents to ChromaDB
Use the data preparation pipeline:

```bash
# Start Airflow services
cd data_prepartion_pipeline
docker-compose up -d airflow-webserver airflow-scheduler

# Access Airflow UI
open http://localhost:8080
# Login: admin / admin

# Trigger the document processing DAG
# This will:
# - Chunk documents
# - Generate embeddings
# - Store in ChromaDB
```

### 2. Verify Documents Added
```bash
docker exec rag-core python -c "
import chromadb
client = chromadb.HttpClient(host='chroma_service', port=8000)
collection = client.get_collection(name='document_embeddings')
print(f'Documents in collection: {collection.count()}')
"
```

### 3. Test Full Pipeline
```bash
cd live_inference_pipeline/CLI
python cli.py
```

## Technical Details

### ChromaDB Version Compatibility

| Component | Version | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Server | 0.5.23 | Compatible |
| Client | 0.5.23 | Compatible |
| API | v2 | Supported |

### Collection Schema
```python
{
    "name": "document_embeddings",
    "metadata": {},
    "embedding_function": None,  # Handled by sentence-transformers
    "data_loader": None
}
```

### Embedding Model
- **Model:** all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- **Dimensions:** 384
- **Type:** sentence-transformers
- **Loading:** Once at startup (performance optimized)

## Warning Messages (Non-Critical)

### Telemetry Warning
```
Failed to send telemetry event ClientStartEvent: capture() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given
```

**Impact:** None - This is a telemetry reporting issue that doesn't affect functionality.

**Reason:** Minor incompatibility in the posthog telemetry library used by ChromaDB.

**Action:** Can be safely ignored. To disable telemetry completely, add to ChromaDB environment:
```yaml
environment:
  - ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=False
```

---

## System Status: OPERATIONAL

**All components are now working correctly:**

1. SQL Injection - FIXED
2. Hardcoded Credentials - FIXED
3. Missing .gitignore - FIXED
4. Unpinned Dependencies - FIXED
5. Performance Bug - FIXED
6. NumPy Compatibility - FIXED
7. ChromaDB Package - FIXED
8. ChromaDB Connection - FIXED
9. Airflow Database - FIXED
10. **ChromaDB Collection - FIXED** (this document)

---

## Summary

The ChromaDB collection issue has been resolved by ensuring version compatibility between the server and client. The collection now exists and is accessible. The system is ready to accept documents and process queries.

**Current Behavior:**
- Queries are processed successfully
- Collection is accessed without errors
- Since collection is empty (0 documents), the system returns a helpful message
- Once documents are added via the data preparation pipeline, the system will retrieve relevant context and generate informed answers

**The RAG pipeline is now fully operational and ready for document ingestion.**
