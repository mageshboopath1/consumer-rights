---

## Service Status

### Shared Services
- ✅ chroma_service - RUNNING (port 8002)
- ✅ postgres_service - RUNNING (port 5432)

### Data Preparation Pipeline
- ✅ chunker-service - RUNNING (port 5001)
- ✅ embedder-service - RUNNING (port 5002)
- ✅ airflow-webserver - RUNNING (port 8080)
- ✅ airflow-scheduler - RUNNING
- ✅ postgres (Airflow DB) - RUNNING

### Live Inference Pipeline
- ✅ rabbitmq - RUNNING and HEALTHY
- ✅ rag-core - RUNNING (connected to ChromaDB with 295 docs)
- ✅ llm-connector - RUNNING
- ✅ pii-filter - RUNNING
- ✅ psql-worker - RUNNING
- ✅ ollama - RUNNING (Gemma 1.1 2B model loaded)

---

## Critical Startup Order

**IMPORTANT:** Services must be started in this specific order:

```bash
# 1. Start shared services FIRST
cd shared_services/chroma
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Start data preparation (if adding documents)
cd ../../data_prepartion_pipeline
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Start live inference pipeline
cd ../live_inference_pipeline
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## Testing the System

### Test RAG Pipeline
```bash
cd live_inference_pipeline/CLI
python cli.py
```

**Expected Flow:**
1. User enters query: "What are consumer rights in India?"
2. PII filter processes query
3. RAG-core retrieves relevant chunks from 295 documents
4. LLM generates contextual answer
5. Response stored in PostgreSQL
6. Answer displayed to user

### Sample Queries to Test
- "What is the Consumer Protection Act?"
- "Where can I file a consumer complaint?"
- "What are the penalties for false advertising?"
- "What is product liability under the Act?"

---

## Performance Characteristics

### RAG-Core
- Model loading: Once at startup (30 seconds)
- Query processing: 2-3 seconds
- Documents retrieved: Top 3 most relevant

### LLM (Ollama - Gemma 1.1 2B)
- Model loading: 34 seconds (one-time)
- Inference: 10-30 seconds per query (CPU)
- Tokens/second: 2-5 (CPU mode)

### Overall Response Time
- End-to-end: 15-40 seconds per query
- Bottleneck: LLM inference (CPU)

---

## Security Features

### SQL Injection Protection
- Parameterized queries
- Table whitelist
- Input validation

### Credentials
- All passwords in `.env` files
- 44-64 character secure passwords
- No hardcoded credentials

### Data Protection
- `.gitignore` prevents sensitive data commits
- PII filtering in pipeline
- Secure database connections

2. live_inference_pipeline/RAG-Core/core.py
3. live_inference_pipeline/RAG-Core/dockerfile
4. live_inference_pipeline/LLM-Connector/dockerfile
5. live_inference_pipeline/docker-compose.yml

10. .gitignore
11-14. Various .env and .env.example files

---

## Known Limitations

### Ollama Performance
- Running on CPU (slow inference)
- 10-30 seconds per response
- Consider GPU deployment for production

### ChromaDB Collection
- Currently has 295 documents
- To add more: Use Airflow DAG with new PDFs
- Collection can be cleared and repopulated

### Network Configuration
- Shared network must be created first
- Services must start in correct order
- DNS resolution depends on proper network setup

---

## Maintenance

### Adding New Documents
```bash
# 1. Place PDF in data_prepartion_pipeline/data/
# 2. Update PDF_FILE_PATH in process_document_dag.py
# 3. Trigger DAG
docker exec airflow-scheduler airflow dags trigger document_processing_pipeline
```

### Monitoring
```bash
# Check all services
docker ps

# Check specific logs
docker logs rag-core
docker logs llm-connector
docker logs airflow-scheduler

# Check ChromaDB document count
docker exec rag-core python -c "
import chromadb
client = chromadb.HttpClient(host='chroma_service', port=8000)
collection = client.get_collection(name='document_embeddings')
print(f'Documents: {collection.count()}')
"
```

### Troubleshooting
1. If services can't connect: Check startup order
2. If ChromaDB empty: Run DAG to populate
3. If queries slow: Normal for CPU-based LLM
4. If network errors: Restart in correct order
